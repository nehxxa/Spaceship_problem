# Spaceship_problem

## Overview
This project aims to predict which passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension during a collision with a spacetime anomaly. Using personal records of the passengers, we built a machine learning model to assist rescue crews in locating and retrieving the missing passengers.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and understand the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict passenger transport status.
- **Submission**: Create a prediction file for the test set.

## Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
